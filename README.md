# Weather-Dashboard

An application in which the user can search a specific city for weather information. When searched the user will be able to see the city's:
- Current Date
- Temperature
- Humitdity
- Wind Speed

Along with the current weather the user will be presented with a five day forecast showing the day's:
- Temperature
- An icon for the day's weather
- Wind speed


Challenges:
- This project was quite difficult in that I was unable to figure out how to have the saved searches run again when clicked. Although the rest of the application is working this is still my biggest roadblock.
